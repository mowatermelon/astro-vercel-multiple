As the tourism market continues to flourish, travelers often face information overload and decision paralysis when choosing destinations and attractions. Traditional tourism recommendations tend to be monotonous, lacking interactivity and engagement, making it difficult to spark user interest and participation.

The "Cultural Tourism Arena" was born to address this challenge. Through an innovative approach of personifying attractions in battle-style interactions, it transforms mundane attraction descriptions into lively "dialogues," helping users understand the unique features of different attractions in a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, enabling them to make travel choices that better align with their preferences.
